# p5playground

This repository contains all little things I try with p5.js, which is a great javascript library for browser manipulation and lots of other things.

## p5_chrome_extension
The p5_chrome_extension is my first attempt to make a funny chrome extension with p5's animation library and some spread sheets. 
At the end I got a funny little extension with which one can let birds fly over the screen.
To install it on your computer you only have to download the folder and put it in your chrome extensions.

For this extension I used sprite 2D art from: [https://opengameart.org/users/bevouliincom](https://opengameart.org/users/bevouliincom)
